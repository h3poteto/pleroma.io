## Packaged (OTP) installation vs Manual (from-source) installations

There is multiple ways to install Pleroma.
<dl>
<dt>Distro-provided packages</dt><dd>This is the recommended method, where you can get the strongest compatibility guarantees and the best dependency-management</dd>
<dt>Pleroma-provided OTP binaries</dt><dd>Intended as fallback for Alpine/Debian-compatible systems lacking a proper Pleroma package, they are heavier than proper distro packages as they also contain Erlang/Elixir and can break after system updates</dd>
<dt>Manual from-source installation</dt><dd>Needs build-dependencies to be installed and manual updates+rebuilds. Allows for easier source-customisations.</dd>
